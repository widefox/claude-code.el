# Claude Code WebSocket IDE Integration Solution

## Summary

I've successfully implemented WebSocket IDE integration between Emacs and Claude with the following features:

1. **Python WebSocket Bridge**: Created a Python server that properly implements the MCP protocol with the required 'mcp' subprotocol
2. **Selection Tracking**: Implemented real-time selection tracking that sends cursor position and selected text to Claude
3. **Automatic Fallback**: The solution automatically uses the Python bridge when websocket.el can't handle the protocol

## Key Files Created

### 1. Python IDE Server (`claude-ide-server-with-selection.py`)
- Implements the full MCP protocol over WebSocket
- Properly handles the 'mcp' subprotocol requirement
- Supports selection tracking via custom `updateSelection` method
- Provides tools: `getCurrentSelection` and `getWorkspaceFolders`

### 2. Simple Python Server (`claude-ide-server-simple.py`)
- Minimal implementation without selection tracking
- Fallback option if the enhanced server has issues

### 3. Bridge Integration (`claude-code-python-bridge.el`)
- Manages the Python server process from Emacs
- Handles server startup, port detection, and cleanup
- Standalone module for testing

### 4. Enhanced Integration (`claude-code-integrated.el`)
- Complete integration that can be added to claude-code.el
- Automatic fallback from native websocket.el to Python bridge
- Selection tracking with debouncing

## How to Use

### Quick Start

1. Install Python dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/claude-code.el
   python3 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   pip install websockets
   ```

2. Start the Python IDE server from Emacs:
   ```elisp
   (load-file "claude-code-python-bridge.el")
   (claude-code-start-python-ide-server)
   ```

3. Connect Claude:
   ```bash
   export CLAUDE_CODE_SSE_PORT=10001  # Use the port shown in Emacs
   export ENABLE_IDE_INTEGRATION=true
   claude
   ```

4. In Claude, run the `/ide` command

### Integration into claude-code.el

To integrate this into the main claude-code.el file:

1. Add the Python bridge code from `claude-code-ide-patch.el` to claude-code.el
2. The enhanced `claude-code--start-websocket-server` function will automatically use the Python bridge as a fallback

## Key Insights

The critical issue was that Claude requires the WebSocket server to accept the 'mcp' subprotocol in the handshake. The server must:

1. Include `subprotocols=['mcp']` when creating the WebSocket server
2. Respond with `Sec-WebSocket-Protocol: mcp` header during handshake
3. Implement the MCP JSON-RPC 2.0 protocol

The websocket.el library doesn't properly handle subprotocol negotiation, which is why the Python bridge was necessary.

## Testing

Test the connection:
```bash
cd /path/to/claude-code.el
source .venv/bin/activate
python test-claude-protocol.py <port>
```

## Features

- ✅ WebSocket connection with proper MCP protocol
- ✅ Automatic server discovery via lock files
- ✅ Selection tracking (cursor position and selected text)
- ✅ Seamless fallback when native websocket.el fails
- ✅ Process management with proper cleanup
- ✅ Debug logging and error handling
